Focuh provides an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that allows AI assistants to interact with your tasks.

## What is MCP?

MCP is a protocol that allows AI assistants to connect to external tools and services. With the Focuh MCP server, AI assistants can:

- **View your tasks** - See what's on your todo list
- **Create tasks** - Add new tasks to your list
- **Update tasks** - Mark tasks as complete, change details
- **Schedule tasks** - Set when tasks should be done

## Supported AI Assistants

  <Card title="Cursor" icon="code">
    Use Focuh directly in your IDE while coding.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Claude Desktop" icon="message">
    Manage tasks from Claude's desktop app.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Setup

### Get Your API Key

1. Go to **Settings** in Focuh
2. Navigate to **API Keys**
3. Click **Generate API Key**
4. Copy the key (you won't be able to see it again)

### Configure Your AI Assistant

Add the Focuh MCP server to your assistant's configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "focuh": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "focuh-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "FOCUH_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Available Commands

Once connected, you can ask your AI assistant to:

- "Show me my tasks for today"
- "Create a task to review the PR"
- "Mark the database migration task as complete"
- "Schedule the meeting prep for 2pm"

<Tip>
The MCP integration works best when you give clear, specific instructions about your tasks.
