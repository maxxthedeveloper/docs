Focus sessions are the core of Focuh. When you start a focus session, you commit to working on a specific task for a set amount of time.

## Starting a Focus Session

1. Select a task from your task list
2. Click the **Focus** button
3. A timer will start counting down
4. Work on your task until the timer completes

## During a Focus Session

While in a focus session:

- **Distracting websites are blocked** (requires the desktop app)
- **Your focus time is tracked** and added to your daily stats
- **Your status is visible** to other Focuh users on the leaderboard

## Completing a Session

When your focus session ends:

- You'll hear a completion sound
- Your focus time is recorded
- You can mark the task as complete or continue working

<Tip>
Short, focused sessions (25-45 minutes) are often more effective than long marathon sessions. Try the Pomodoro technique!
