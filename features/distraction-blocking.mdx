The Focuh Chrome Extension blocks websites you find distracting while you're in a focus session.

## How It Works

1. Install the [Focuh Chrome Extension](/integrations/chrome-extension)
2. Add websites to your block list
3. Start a focus session
4. Blocked sites will show a "Stay Focused" page instead of the distracting content

## Managing Your Block List

You can manage your blocked sites from:

- **The Chrome extension popup** - Click the Focuh icon in your browser
- **The Focuh web app** - Go to Settings → Blocked Sites

## Common Sites to Block

Popular productivity killers:

- `twitter.com` / `x.com`
- `reddit.com`
- `youtube.com`
- `facebook.com`
- `instagram.com`
- `tiktok.com`
- `news.ycombinator.com`

<Warning>
Blocking is only active during focus sessions. When you're not focusing, you can browse freely.
