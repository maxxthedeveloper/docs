The Focuh desktop app blocks websites you find distracting while you're in a focus session.

## How It Works

1. Download the [Focuh desktop app](/download)
2. Add websites to your block list in Settings → Focus Blocker
3. Start a focus session
4. Blocked sites will show a "Stay Focused" overlay instead of the distracting content

## Managing Your Block List

You can manage your blocked sites from:

- **The Focuh web app** - Go to Settings → Focus Blocker
- **The desktop app** - Your block list syncs automatically

## Common Sites to Block

Popular productivity killers:

- `twitter.com` / `x.com`
- `reddit.com`
- `youtube.com`
- `facebook.com`
- `instagram.com`
- `tiktok.com`
- `news.ycombinator.com`

<Warning>
Blocking is only active during focus sessions. When you're not focusing, you can browse freely.
</Warning>

## Desktop App Features

The desktop app supports distraction blocking, but the implementation differs by OS:

- **macOS (native)**: System-wide blocking across Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and more
  - Uses **Accessibility + Automation** (AppleScript) — no admin password, just one-time permissions
- **Windows (extension)**: Website blocking runs via the **Focuh Blocker browser extension** (Chrome/Edge)
  - No “Accessibility” permission exists on Windows; the extension enforces redirects during focus sessions
- **Syncs with web app**: Your block list is the same everywhere
