The Focuh desktop app blocks websites you find distracting while you're in a focus session.

## How It Works

1. Download the [Focuh desktop app](/download)
2. Add websites to your block list in Settings → Focus Blocker
3. Start a focus session
4. Blocked sites will show a "Stay Focused" overlay instead of the distracting content

## Managing Your Block List

You can manage your blocked sites from:

- **The Focuh web app** - Go to Settings → Focus Blocker
- **The desktop app** - Your block list syncs automatically

## Common Sites to Block

Popular productivity killers:

- `twitter.com` / `x.com`
- `reddit.com`
- `youtube.com`
- `facebook.com`
- `instagram.com`
- `tiktok.com`
- `news.ycombinator.com`

<Warning>
Blocking is only active during focus sessions. When you're not focusing, you can browse freely.
</Warning>

## Desktop App Features

The native desktop app provides system-wide blocking:

- **Works across all browsers** - Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and more
- **Uses Accessibility API** - No admin password required, just one-time permission
- **Syncs with web app** - Your block list is the same everywhere
