<Update label="January 2026" description="Unreleased" tags={["New Feature", "Bug Fix", "Improvement"]}>
  - **AI workflow guard**: Fixed AI assistant getting stuck repeating onboarding questions (e.g. "What could you finish THIS MONTH?"). The chat route now detects the current workflow step and injects anti-loop protection, forcing tool calls when appropriate and preventing re-asks of answered questions.
  - **Attempt caps per phase**: If the AI stays in the same onboarding phase for 3+ turns without advancing, the system escalates—extracting the best available goal content from user messages and forcing a createGoal call. Prevents infinite loops even with vague user input.
  - **Prompt editor (dev)**: The "Prompt" button in the AI chat panel now works—reads and writes the system prompt file in development mode. Prod displays a clear error since the filesystem is read-only.
  - **Instant Mission toggle**: Switching between Week and Mission views now feels instant—goals and chat data are cached in memory, AI settings are shared across components (eliminating duplicate fetches), and the chat sidebar loads in the background while goals paint immediately
  - **Snappier drag-and-drop**: Moving tasks between columns now feels instant—optimistic updates commit synchronously before the drag preview disappears, eliminating the perceptible delay on drop
  - **Multi-provider AI Assistant**: Choose between Claude (Anthropic), ChatGPT (OpenAI), or Gemini (Google) to power the AI assistant. Configure API keys for each provider in Settings → AI Assistant and switch between them anytime.
  - **Dynamic model selection**: Model dropdown now automatically shows the latest available models for your selected provider, derived from the installed AI SDK packages. No more outdated model lists.
  - **Goals/Mission page**: New hierarchical goals view with four time horizons (This year, This month, This week, Today) to help you plan from high-level objectives down to daily tasks
  - **AI Assistant**: Built-in AI chat panel on the Mission page powered by Claude. Reads your goals, tasks, and focus time to provide contextual advice. Proposes actions that require your confirmation before executing.
  - **Mission/Week toggle**: Navigate between the Goals/Mission view and the Week/Kanban view from the top navigation bar
  - **Shared navigation shell**: Mission and Week views now share a persistent layout, making navigation instant with no layout jump; both views have consistent nav height and a horizontally centered Mission/Week toggle
  - Fixed the signed-out landing view on `/` accidentally showing the in-app navbar
  - **AI Settings**: Configure your Anthropic API key and customize the AI's system prompt in Settings → AI Assistant
  - **AI Model Selector**: Choose which Claude model powers the AI assistant (Sonnet 4, Opus 4, 3.7 Sonnet, or 3.5 Haiku) from Settings → AI Assistant
  - **Chat memory**: AI conversations are persisted across sessions with full thread history
  - Fixed AI chat replies briefly appearing then disappearing in new chats (server now authenticates Convex writes using Clerk's `convex` JWT template)
  - **AI Tool-enabled Assistant**: The AI can now read your goals, tasks, calendar events, and focus sessions via tools. Ask questions like "What are my goals?" or "Show me today's tasks" and the AI will fetch live data from your account.
  - **AI Action Proposals with Confirmation**: The AI can propose changes to your goals, tasks, calendar events, and focus sessions. Each proposal appears as a card with Confirm/Cancel buttons—nothing is modified until you explicitly confirm.
  - **AI Google Calendar Sync**: The AI can propose syncing or unsyncing tasks and calendar events with Google Calendar. On confirmation, events are created/updated/deleted in your connected Google account.
  - **AI Focus Session Control**: The AI can propose starting, pausing, resuming, or ending focus sessions on your behalf (with confirmation).
  - **Expanded AI Actions**: New action types for updating tasks (title, estimate, priority), scheduling/unscheduling time blocks, moving tasks between dates, and managing internal calendar events.
  - **Clerk↔Convex auth integration**: Database functions now derive user identity from Clerk JWT tokens for improved security; user IDs are never passed from client
  - **Bounded AI context**: Thread summaries auto-compress conversation history; user memory stores stable facts/preferences; both capped to prevent token inflation
  - **AI agent auditing foundation**: All AI tool calls use internal Convex functions with ownership verification
  - **Blocking permissions banner**: Desktop app now shows a top-nav banner when website blocking can't work due to missing permissions (Accessibility or Automation)
  - Clarified that **app blocking is macOS-only** (for now) and prevented native blocking sync attempts on unsupported platforms (fixes confusing “it doesn’t work” states on Windows/web)
  - **Windows website blocking (extension)**: Added `/extension-auth` + `/api/focus-status` so the Focuh Blocker browser extension can enforce website blocking on Windows (Chrome/Edge) without macOS Accessibility
  - Added **Automation permission check** for website blocking; previously only Accessibility was checked, but AppleScript browser control also requires Automation permission in macOS
  - Permissions modal now shows Automation status alongside Accessibility and Notifications with a button to trigger browser permission prompts
  - Expanded browser prewarm to include Dia, Comet, Sigma, Atlas, and ChatGPT so permission prompts appear during setup rather than mid-session
  - Improved logging of AppleScript failures to help diagnose permission issues
  - **Blocked apps are now closed** instead of just hidden during focus sessions; if the app refuses to quit (e.g., unsaved changes dialog), it falls back to hiding; persistent re-opens escalate to force-terminate
  - **Windows download**: `/download` now surfaces Windows installers (x64) when available, and the primary download button auto-picks macOS vs Windows based on your device
  - Task cards now show **minutes left** in real time while focusing (e.g. 60 → 54 after 6 minutes)
  - Fixed "today" focus attribution across the Europe/Berlin midnight boundary (sessions that cross midnight no longer land on the wrong day)
  - Community dropdown now only shows focusing + online users (no "offline focused today" rows)
  - Clarified that "today" labels use the Europe/Berlin day boundary
  - Improved online presence accuracy across multiple tabs by relying on heartbeat TTL rather than deleting presence on unmount
  - Focus sessions no longer auto-pause after estimate + 30 minutes (prevents sessions feeling "stuck" around 2 hours for common estimates like 90 minutes)
  - Leaderboard "todos completed" no longer counts subtasks (only top-level tasks)
  - 2026 leaderboards: year grid now matches the page width; restored "Top 10 contenders" under the grid; future-day tooltip now says "To be determined"
  - Fixed blocked-site redirect showing "No active focus session" after pausing/stopping/resuming a task; now reliably shows the task name
  - Fixed Google Calendar sync showing events 1 hour ahead by using the client's timezone instead of UTC when creating/updating events
  - **Polished input focus states**: Removed the ugly inner gray outline on chat and goals inputs; standardized subtle monochrome hover/focus/disabled states across all text inputs for a cleaner, more cohesive feel
  - **Robust focus time tracking**: Focus time now flushes immediately when you pause or quit the desktop app—no more "lost" minutes. Leaderboards and community dropdown show your actual focused time without the previous caps that made overtime sessions appear stuck. Every second you focus is now accurately tracked and persisted.
