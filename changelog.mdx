<Update label="December 2025" description="v0.2.18" tags={["Bug Fix"]}>
  - Fixed time input on task cards: users can now enter any time value (e.g., 90 minutes) even on tasks with extensive focus history
  - Time pill now shows and edits the estimated time directly, making it simpler and more intuitive
</Update>

<Update label="December 2025" description="v0.2.17" tags={["Bug Fix"]}>
  - Fixed critical bug where focus time was lost when session was auto-paused by cleanup
  - Previously, if your laptop slept briefly during a focus session, only the time before sleep was saved
  - Now all focus time is correctly tracked and saved, even if the session is interrupted
</Update>

<Update label="December 2025" description="v0.2.16" tags={["Bug Fix"]}>
  - Fixed auto-update not working by adding missing `updater:default` permission to Tauri capabilities
  - Users on v0.2.14 or v0.2.15 will need to manually download this version, but future updates will work automatically
</Update>

<Update label="December 2025" description="v0.2.15" tags={["New Feature"]}>
  - New Focus Page: when visiting blocked websites, you're redirected to a compassionate refocus page instead of a popup overlay
  - Helps you break down tasks with "What can you get done in 5 minutes?" prompt
  - Creates subtasks directly from the focus page
  - 5-minute sprint timer with subtask list to help you get back into flow
  - Subtasks are checkable from both the main view and sprint timer
</Update>

<Update label="December 2025" description="v0.2.14" tags={["Bug Fix"]}>
  - Added NSUserNotificationUsageDescription to Info.plist for proper macOS notification permission prompts
  - Fixed app icon (32x32.png) format to RGBA for Tauri build compatibility
</Update>

<Update label="December 2025" description="v0.2.10" tags={["Improvement", "Bug Fix"]}>
  - Improved Tauri startup experience: show a native splash immediately and avoid the long blank/white window while the UI loads
  - Fixed blocked-site focus overlay window corners by making the native overlay transparent (prevents background bleed behind the rounded UI)
  - Fixed notification permission check to use native macOS API instead of unreliable Web Notification API
  - Standardized blocked-app notifications to use Tauri’s official notification plugin; in `tauri dev` macOS may group them under Terminal
  - Prevented confusing “Add” no-ops in Focus Blocker by disabling add when a website/app is already on the blocklist
  - Aligned day headers with task cards and section dividers for cleaner visual rhythm
  - Fixed a mobile UI build parsing error triggered by an invalid TSX comment placement
  - Fixed Vercel build failing on `/auth/tauri` by wrapping `useSearchParams()` behind a Suspense boundary (Next.js 16 requirement)
</Update>

<Update label="December 2025" description="v0.2.13" tags={["Bug Fix", "Improvement"]}>
  - Fixed Tauri auth onboarding: “Sign in with browser” now reliably opens the system browser (adds a native OS-level fallback when shell plugin open fails)
  - Moved the desktop app version label to the left of the focus indicator in the top bar
</Update>

<Update label="December 2024" description="v0.2.8" tags={["Bug Fix"]}>
  - Fixed app/website blocking continuing after focus session ends
  - Improved notification icon handling on macOS
  - Added cleanup to ensure blocking stops when session ends from any source
  - Request notification permission on launch (Tauri) and show real notification permission status in the permissions modal
</Update>

<Update label="December 2024" description="v0.2.0" tags={["New Feature", "Improved"]}>
  - Native macOS website blocking via Accessibility API
  - Shows blocking modal when visiting distracting sites during focus sessions
  - Modal reappears after 15 seconds if closed while still on blocked site
  - No admin password required - uses browser URL monitoring
  - Redesigned blocking modal with minimalistic Apple-style design
  - Reduced modal size from 1000x680 to 440x260 for cleaner appearance
  - Added 12px rounded corners to modal window for modern macOS appearance
  - Refined typography and spacing for better readability
  - Focus Blocker settings redesigned with Websites/Apps segment control
  - Added master toggle to enable/disable blocking (on by default for macOS)
  - Web users see "Only on MacOS" messaging with disabled inputs
</Update>
