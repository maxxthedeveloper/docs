<Update label="December 2025" description="v0.2.10" tags={["Improvement", "Bug Fix"]}>
  - Improved Tauri startup experience: show a native splash immediately and avoid the long blank/white window while the UI loads
  - Fixed blocked-site focus overlay window corners by making the native overlay transparent (prevents background bleed behind the rounded UI)
  - Fixed notification permission check to use native macOS API instead of unreliable Web Notification API
  - Standardized blocked-app notifications to use Tauri’s official notification plugin; in `tauri dev` macOS may group them under Terminal
  - Prevented confusing “Add” no-ops in Focus Blocker by disabling add when a website/app is already on the blocklist
  - Aligned day headers with task cards and section dividers for cleaner visual rhythm
  - Fixed a mobile UI build parsing error triggered by an invalid TSX comment placement
  - Fixed Vercel build failing on `/auth/tauri` by wrapping `useSearchParams()` behind a Suspense boundary (Next.js 16 requirement)
</Update>

<Update label="December 2025" description="v0.2.13" tags={["Bug Fix", "Improvement"]}>
  - Fixed Tauri auth onboarding: “Sign in with browser” now reliably opens the system browser (adds a native OS-level fallback when shell plugin open fails)
  - Moved the desktop app version label to the left of the focus indicator in the top bar
</Update>

<Update label="December 2024" description="v0.2.8" tags={["Bug Fix"]}>
  - Fixed app/website blocking continuing after focus session ends
  - Improved notification icon handling on macOS
  - Added cleanup to ensure blocking stops when session ends from any source
  - Request notification permission on launch (Tauri) and show real notification permission status in the permissions modal
</Update>
