Focuh leaderboards add a social element to productivity. See how your focus time compares to others.

## How It Works

Your daily focus time is tracked and displayed on the leaderboard. Compete with:

- **Global users** - See where you rank among all Focuh users
- **Friends** - Add friends and compete in a private leaderboard

## Your Rank

Your rank is based on your total focus time. The more you focus, the higher you climb!

## Privacy

You can control your leaderboard visibility in Settings:

- **Public** - Anyone can see your focus stats
- **Friends only** - Only friends can see your stats
- **Private** - Your stats are hidden from leaderboards

<Tip>
A little healthy competition can be a great motivator! Challenge a friend to a focus duel.
